      "F 1. Why do many kids with autism Avoid eye contact ?\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F Different reasons, There is a difference between kids who actively avoid eye contact and kids who haven’t learned how to use eye contact during communication. For active avoiders, there is a sensory component where it is unpleasant for them to make direct eye to eye contact. One of the core deficits for individuals with autism is difficulty coordinating verbal and non-verbal means of communication. For example, while speaking to someone, a child may forget to make eye contact (which makes it difficult to know to whom the verbalization is directed). In addition, individuals with autism do not find communicative meaning in others’ eyes like the rest of us. Thus, they are not drawn to others’ eyes as information sources. Because of difficulty attaching meaning to the facial cues of caregivers and peers which relates to the child’s social-communication skills.\n",

      "B \n",
      "F 2. Why do many kids with autism . . . Cover their eyes/face/ears with their hands ?\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F This could relate to many things, such as the child covering their face as a way to block out too much sensory stimuli, to self-regulate, or to express feeling scared/anxious. Many children with autism have auditory sensitivities to specific sounds, such as a fire engine, baby crying, or toilet flushing. Covering their ears is one way to lessen the auditory input. Children with autism are often hyper-sensitive to auditory stimuli. Thus, sounds that are tolerable to us may be very loud and uncomfortable for them. Covering ears can often become a learned behavior and may be linked to anxiety as a child becomes fearful of potential unpleasant noises.\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F 3. Why do many kids with autism . . . Startle easily\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F The child may have difficulty anticipating everyday events, and filtering irrelevant social and environmental stimuli. When children startle easily, the result is frequently a “fight or flight” response.\n",
      "\n",
      "F It may be sensitivity to their environments. A sound that we could tolerate may be startling to someone who is more sensitive to auditory input than others.\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F 4. Why do many kids with autism . . .Echo/repeat words/phrases\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F One of the primary communication deficits in autism is the tendency to echo or repeat words or phrases that are heard in one’s environment. Because the brain’s “language center” has difficulty coming up with language on its own, it copies what it hears from the world around it and uses it in place of original words and sentences of its own. It’s sort of like a Rolodex of phrases that the person pulls from at any given time in the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "F Repeating words, or echolalia, is a common learning style for children with autism. Children with autism often learn language in chunks rather than creatively word by word. In addition, repeating words and phrases often serves a communicative purpose such as saying “yes” or helping with processing of information. Echolalia may relate to the child with autism having difficulty using more complex and spontaneous language. Echolalia can be a developmental phase and working alongside a SLP is very helpful to identify intervention strategies. As children develop more language, they may repeat phrases (e.g., from a movie) as a social initiation, or may learn to ask the same questions during conversation which helps make the interaction more predictable.\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F 5. Why do many kids with autism . . .Not talk at all\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F Talking or expressive language development requires understanding and use of symbols. Words, after all, are simply symbols for things, actions, and concepts. Sometimes children with autism lack or have significant delays in that ability. Children with difficulty with symbolic representation often have difficulty with understanding of language and use of other communication systems (e.g. sign language, Picture Exchange Communication System). Sometimes, children demonstrate the ability to understand language but have difficulty putting sounds together to form words. This can be a result of a motor speech disorder such as apraxia of speech. It’s difficult to know why some children with autism do not talk or express themselves verbally. If possible, accessing alternative methods of communication, such as using gestures, pictures, typing, or a voice-output device is an important part of their social development.\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F 6. Why do many kids with autism . . .Walk on their toes\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F Toe-walking may be a learned habit (many toddlers walk on their toes), or may relate to motor coordination challenges, a tight Achilles tendon, or a sensory processing difference. Toe-walking is also seen with other neurological or developmental disorders, such as cerebral palsy. Children with autism often present with stereotyped motor movements, one of which may be walking on their tip-toes. Others hypothesize that walking on toes reduces over stimulation in the feet that can occur as a result of walking on the entire foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F 7. Why do many kids with autism . . .Flap their hands\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F Children with autism tend to have repetitive motor behaviors such as waving or flapping their hands. This arm and hand motion may be accompanied with other motor mannerisms, such as jumping or head turning. Repetitive motor mannerisms, such as flapping hands (but also tensing parts of their body, jumping or “dancing”) are often linked to strong emotions (such as excitement or frustration). We see similar behavior in babies who eventually “grow out” of the behavior. These may also be self-soothing behaviors and/or attempts at regulating when what is perceived as overwhelming upset/excitement/boredom/anxiety is present.\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F 8. Why do many kids with autism . . .Like to spin and jump\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F Spinning and jumping are also examples of repetitive motor behaviors. When a child is spinning or jumping he/she is activating the vestibular system. The child may seek vestibular stimulation as a means to elicit “feel good” sensations and/or also to positively affect his/her arousal. In other words, many children with autism seek sensory information or experiences from the environment (due to feeling under-stimulated). They may also use spinning and jumping as a way of regulating themselves (i.e.: when they are stressed, anxious, or overwhelmed). Spinning and jumping can help one feel regulated and “grounded.”\n",

      "F 9. Why do many kids with autism . . .Have difficulty sitting still\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F The child may have sensory-motor challenges, or may have difficulty with attending behaviors. It is not uncommon for individuals with autism to present with hyperactivity and “fidgety” behavior. This is related to an executive functioning deficit that leads to difficulty regulating and planning behaviors and resisting impulses.\n",

      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F When we think about it developmentally, children look at objects that are visually pleasing – such as rotating objects (fans, wheels, pinwheels). Fixating on certain things could also relate to visual processing, such as seeing the components of objects rather than the “whole” object, or perhaps the child has difficulty expanding play with toys and engages in repetitive play. Individuals with autism tend to have brains that think about things over and over. They may fixate on things that they find enjoyable or may get “stuck” trying to finish a task or game. A brain affected by autism tends to be more rigid and “black and white”. So it is hard to be flexible with a number of interests and ways of thinking about things.\n",

      "F Some children don’t realize they are staring – but may be “tuning out” what is overwhelming them or daydreaming about preferred interests. Individuals with autism are often very detail-oriented. Thus, they may notice details in the environment that we do not, and may get fixated on those details (thus, blocking all else out of their attention span and appearing to be “spaced out”).\n",

More families are joining Autism Parents Hub and with all your support we can improve the chances of children living happily with their abilities. Our goal is to provide support, help and inspire families who is facing difficult situations and challenges. Our weapons are help, support, education, awareness and positive approach. Do not lose hope. The skills and developmental milestones may or may not come with medicines, diet and moving kids to hostels or institutes etc. But the progress will surely come only with parents help, love and support. Our children are looking for HELP not for the treatments and therapies. They stepped in your family and looking at you for help. Just help. Only help and THE HELP. You are best parents for your child. Do not complain on children about their responses and behaviors.\n",

Children with the given condition might not process or filter information about the expressions, sounds, words, thoughts, emotions, responses and feelings. So this often leads frustration and use different inappropriate methods of communicating feelings, getting attention, or protecting a territory.\n",

      "B \n",

Whether your child is hitting siblings, kids at school, or even himself, you need to know what triggers the attacks.  Is he upset about other children invading his space (getting too close, taking his toys, etc.)?  Or is he frustrated by an inability to communicate thoughts and feelings?  Maybe he’s using self-abuse as a method of focusing or “drowning out” other sensory input.  If you can’t figure it out on your own, you may want to see a professional who specializes in autism or behavioral analysis.\n",

If you find that your child is hitting a sibling (this generally occurs during disputes over toys), then you must teach him the consequences of his actions just as you would any other child. Because children are often unable form a correlation between the pain they feel when they are hit and the pain they are inflicting on others through hitting, it will do no good to appeal to their sympathies or allow the other child to reciprocate as an example. Instead you may simply have to train them through cause and effect methods. \n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F So if your kids are fighting over a toy, take the toy away for a period of time. Or if the child is hitting other children for attention, put him in a time out. It may take awhile, but eventually he will learn that hitting equals consequences. When he has finished the time out, have him apologize so that you know he understands what he did wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F If cause and effect does not garner the desired results, you may want to switch tactics by implementing a rewards system. Try teaching your child an alternative to hitting others when he feels strong emotions. For example, use a designated pillow for hitting in place of a sibling so that he can act out his frustration without hurting anyone. Or teach him to hug instead of hitting (if he us able and willing to do so) so that he receives positive attention instead of negative. If he cannot form these associations, simply teach him to go to his own space, away from others, rather than hitting or acting out. This will at least keep him from hurting other children. Then encourage him when he utilizes his substitute by offering positive attention, praise, or other rewards.\n",

      "B \n",
      "F Although these kinds of behaviors can be extremely challenging, it is really important to try and keep as calm as possible so that your child is unable to ‘feed’ off your reaction. It is also important to be consistent in your approach and for the other adults around to use the same consistent approach, so that your child does not get mixed messages and can be really clear about what is expected.\n",

      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F By reducing language, your child is less likely to feel overloaded by information and more likely to be able to process what you say. Children with an ASD are often strong visual learners and can have difficulties with short-term memory. It can be very effective to back up what you are saying to your child with visual supports, which consolidate what you say and to help your child really understand the information.\n",

Even if the behavior or task is very short, eg one minute, if it is followed by lots of praise and a reward, the child learns what behavior is acceptable. But if the undesirable behavior is met with a lack of attention and redirection, it is likely to stop.\n",

      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F It can be helpful to build in opportunities for children (and parents!) to relax each day. You can do this by, for example, looking at bubble lamps, smelling essential oils, listening to music, massages, swinging on a swing or whatever you can find that seems to help your child relax. Challenging behavior can often be diffused by an activity that releases energy or pent-up anger or anxiety. This might be punching a punch bag, bouncing on a trampoline or running around the garden, which you can make into a chase game.\n",

So it would take atleast 9 months of intensive stimulation at home to get his language age appropriate. Hence I suggest, to work with child at home intensively for next 9 months. Pre/ play isn't necessary much, moreover when you put him in 4 hrs of school, you won't have time to work with him at home. Presently acquiring language is more important than academic skills. Number of hours of productive parent-child interaction is more important than number of speech therapy sessions. Hope this helps..\n",

      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F 👇👇👇\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F 1. Yoga develops motor skills. Kids with autism frequently experience delayed motor development, which can be improved as yoga tones muscles, enhances balance and stability, and develops body awareness and coordination. As motor skills develop, children have a greater sense of their physical self in space and in relation to others, and can improve their gait and stability. This leads to…\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F 2. Yoga improves confidence and social skills. Poor coordination often yields low self-esteem as kids may be singled out or teased for not moving or behaving like other children, or not excelling in sports and outdoor activities. By learning self-control and self-calming techniques through yoga, they are likely to grow confidence in interacting with other children and refine their social skills. Learning to work together in a yoga class and playing with partner poses can also increase confidence within group settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F 3. Yoga provides sensory integration. Children with autism often suffer from a highly sensitive nervous system and are easily over stimulated by bright lights, new textures, loud noises, strong tastes and smells. Yoga’s natural setting of dim lights, soft music, smooth mats, and “inside” voices creates a comforting environment largely protected from unknown or aggressive stimuli in which calming down becomes enjoyable. Yoga’s physical poses allow nervous energy to be released from the body in a controlled manner, also leading to a calming sensation. Less stimulation means less uncontrollable behavior, outbursts and repetitive nervous movements – which is further enhanced by…\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F 4. Yoga provides coping techniques to both kids and parents. Whether teaching the child breathing techniques for self-calming, talking the class through a guided visualization the child can use when getting anxious, or sharing flashcards of the day’s poses with parents to use at home, yoga provides an awesome toolbox to parents and siblings. It is a transportable practice that both parents and kids can draw from for a lifetime and share a meaningful home activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F 5. Yoga facilitates self-awareness. Yoga is particularly instrumental in helping kids with autism learn self-regulation. By becoming aware of their bodies and aware of their breathing, yoga provides them with the ability to cope when they start to feel anxious or upset. Many 'Yoga for Autism' classes teach yoga poses or breathing techniques specifically intended to help children contend with their escalating emotions. Since these children are visually oriented, savvy instructors add a visual element so that the child has a colored picture of each pose near his or her mat. Often, classes incorporate other experiences known to benefit a child on the autism spectrum, such as massage, music, dance, rhymes and stories\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F 6. Yoga engages the emotional brain. We all know that yoga is far from purely physical, and this combination of movement, music, breath work and story telling activates the brain’s emotional region. This encourages children to develop awareness of their emotions and those of others, as well as keeps their attention in the class. Music is another powerful tool that the yoga instructor can share with parents to use at home to recreate the environment of a yoga class.\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F 7. Yoga is orderly and consistent. Ideally, the class will be scheduled at the same time and same day of the week, with the students’ mats in the same layout, in the same room, with the same instructor(s). In my experience, there was one instructor per student, with the pairing the same week after week to impart a sense of trust and steadiness. This element of order is very important for a child and communicates stability – a state much preferred to being unexpected and thus out of control. Students may also enjoy learning yoga sequences, such as modified sun salutations, that are performed in the same order at every class. The class should have an opening and closing routine or practice – singing, tuning in, etc. – that further supports the students’ need for order .\n",

Articulation was ok but no functional language. He would pull my hand to. Show me what he wanted. As soon as he got diagnosed we started speech therapy and OT. But he wasn't talking. Slowly ecolhalia developed. So we started showing him pictures with written words and sounded it out for him. I remember labling everything in my house. I started taking him to every object and showing him the written name. I would say it first and made him repeat. Slowly he learned. At the same time we started using iPad. He enjoyed touching the pictures that made sound. So labeling apps really helped. \n",
      "\n",
      "F Slowly he started requesting what he needed. Only one word for .... Water, swing, etc later we made him say I want/can I have. Lots and lots of modeling. Then we moved on to actions .... Play, read, drive etc. And at he same time taught him funtion of objects ex book is for reading, ball is for playing etc. So he learned to say I want to read.\n",

You have to become a therapist and need to understand what is special education and  please do remember that \"Understanding the child is the golden key to help children with Autism\". Please come out of the emotional, business and technical trap. No magic, No miracle and No medicine. Only love, acceptance, advocacy and support will help the children. If you are posting a question or concern about your child in terms of sensory, behaviour, communication, body movements, social and cognitive related issues then you need to read about what is Autism and how it effects the child. thank you for understanding.\n",

My daughter 3.4 years with SPD is on OT, speech therapy, GFCF diet since 1 year. Since then there is a gradual improvement and at present her sensory issues have reduced alot and speech is not attained yet. Regarding GFCF diet can be followed by every one. But usefulness of it should be assessed and continued if positive results are shown. As they are growing children they need good nutrition for their proper growth and development. So when your stopping certain type of food especially milk their dietary calcium is cut off and their bone health is hampered. Before starting GFCF diet please take suggestions from your pediatrician and you also can meet dietitians and discuss about the gfcf diet and ask them to give a diet chart which can be tailor made according to your child which can give a good nutrition to your child and help in proper growth and development. You also can supplement the child with multivitamin and calcium only under the supervision of your pediatrician. To certain extent GFCF diet has helped my daughter. But only following GFCF doesn't help much. OT, ABA, ST combinedly can do miracles.\n",

      "B \n",
      "F “The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.”  The invisible relationships between the parts (how they relate together) provide more meaning to the collection of parts alone.  Central coherence is the brain’s ability to see the invisible relationships between the parts, which give an overall meaning to the whole.  The brains of neurotypical (NT) people have a natural ability to seek out overall meaning when looking at an array of details.  We seek overall “meaning” immediately when viewing detail.  We immediately search for invisible relationships that provide meaning to the details.  When looking at something, our brains scan for a few important details to grasp the big picture.  From the first impression, we then tend to use the overall picture to provide the backdrop for defining the individual details.  Our brains seek out \"meaning\" first, then detail second.  We tend to think from \"general to specific.\"  This is what happens when we immediately see a smiling face out of two dots with a half moon under it.  Or, when we quickly skim written material, missing misspelled words, and reading the meaning without paying attention to the individual words.   This also allows us to read the invisible context that provides meaning to how we interpret what people are saying and doing.  We often “infer,” meaning quickly when faced with a few details.  From there, we go on to interpret all other details by the initial interpretation we assume.\n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F For many people on the spectrum, their brains tend to work the opposite.  Their brains focus on the detail and not the overall picture.  They struggle to see the invisible relationships between the parts and have to search for overall meaning by piecing together the details.  They are more acutely aware of the fine detail and do not immediately get pulled into seeing the relationships (hidden meaning) between the parts.  They first scan the many details and then put them together to form the overall meaning.  They tend to think \"specific to general\" rather than \"general to specific.\"  They see the parts literally, with less bias, and then piece the parts together to form the overall picture.  \n",
      "\n",
      "B \n",
      "F This difference in processing provides the person with autism many unique strengths as well as weaknesses.  They have a much more concise, concrete, literal interpretation of what they perceive.  They are very strong detailed thinkers, can perceive detail with minimal bias, and pick out imperfections among the detail.   Unlike the neurotypical brain, autistics often perceive all of the details at once with minimal filtering:  however, piecing them together might take time.   This leads some to have photographic memories, perfect pitch, and profound memory for details and facts.  They also can acutely perceive the physical relationships (physical patterns) between the details.  They often are superior in perceiving sensory patterns (e.g., visual and auditory patterns) that we may not attend to.    For tasks requiring extreme acuity to detail (e.g. engineering) their processing is very strong.  Also, there fine attention to sensory patterns can be valuable in arts and music.  However, as we will see later, when it comes to interacting and relating, this weak ability to rapidly interpret the overall picture (central coherence) can leave them struggling.\n",

However, when living daily in our neurotypical driven society, the limited ability to read the invisible social context, infer perspectives and intentions of others, and vague social rules that come with inferring the invisible relationships often renders them confused and clashing with the expectations of others.

The entire school staff was involved in such unethical practices. We came to know of this appalling reality on  when he came back from the school with slap marks, a small cut on lower abdomen, pinch marks and bruises on various places on the body. My son is emotionally scarred for life. When we finally got to see the CCTV footage this morning we couldn't believe what we saw. His  teacher was slapping him, twisting his arms and bending his fingers on the ground. Another teacher is first seen pinching and bending his fingers and then dragging him to the bathroom where there is no CCTV coverage and coming out sometime later with my son crying profusely. But it seems this is the usual culture of the school as nobody seems to notice a child been shown slaps, beaten, dragged to the bathroom and crying so much. \n",

      "F The moment I saw him like that that day, I checked with the school.  The next day I am asked to stop sending my son to the school and told us that she is not aware of how he got wounded. So we informed other parents and eventually the school  suggested some half-hearted measures - let's train the staff to handle inappropriate behaviors, let's NOT terminate the teacher only suspend temporarly ..that too not immediately as it is difficult to find good staff and say sorry to the concerned parents as that may bring their life back on track and may return their sanctity.  \n",
